I confirm that I am ordering the correct title, format, edition, quantity and of the items in my shopping cart and request Online Book Store to source these items on my behalf. I understand I have a cooling-off period for physical books on this order and after that period expires, this purchase is deemed a firm sale (i.e. non-returnable). This is because Online Book Store is purchasing the items from suppliers on my behalf, often with no option to return them. I verify that these items are being purchased for personal or business use and are not being purchased for commercial resale.
